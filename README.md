# Jupyter Book for repo.haposan.com site

How to build this book
---
Make sure you have installed packages in `requirements.txt`, then run `make` to build the book in HTML format.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
make
```

The command will then build HTML in the `./_build/html/index.html`, which you can open in your localhost.
