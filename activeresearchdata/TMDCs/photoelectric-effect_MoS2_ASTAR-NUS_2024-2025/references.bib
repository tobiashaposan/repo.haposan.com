	abstract = {The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) occurs in solids with broken inversion symmetry and refers to DC generation due to uniform illumination, without the need of heterostructures or interfaces, a feature that is distinct from the traditional photovoltaic effect. Its existence has been demonstrated almost 50 years ago, but predictive theories only appeared in the last ten years, allowing for the identiﬁcation of different mechanisms and the determination of their relative importance in real materials. It is now generally accepted that there is an intrinsic mechanism that is insensitive to scattering, called shift current, where ﬁrst-principles calculations can now give highly accurate predictions. Another important but more extrinsic mechanism, called ballistic current, is also attracting a great deal of attention, but due to the complicated scattering processes, its numerical calculation for real materials is only made possible quite recently. In addition, an intrinsic ballistic current, usually referred to as injection current, will appear under circularly polarized light and has wide application in experiments. In this review, experiments that are pertinent to the theory development are reviewed, and a signiﬁcant portion is devoted to discussing the recent progress in the theories of BPVE and their numerical implementations. As a demonstration of the capability of the newly developed theories, a brief review of the materials’ design strategies enabled by the theory development is given. Finally, remaining questions in the BPVE ﬁeld and possible future directions are discussed to inspire further investigations.},

Beginning with the first isolation of graphene, mechanical exfoliation has been a key to provide high-quality two-dimensional materials, but despite improvements it is still limited in yield, lateral size and contamination. Here we introduce a contamination-free, one-step and universal Au-assisted mechanical exfoliation method and demonstrate its effectiveness by isolating 40 types of single-crystalline monolayers, including elemental two-dimensional crystals, metal-dichalcogenides, magnets and superconductors. Most of them are of millimeter-size and high-quality, as shown by transfer-free measurements of electron microscopy, photo spectroscopies and electrical transport. Large suspended two-dimensional crystals and heterojunctions were also prepared with high-yield. Enhanced adhesion between the crystals and the substrates enables such efficient exfoliation, for which we identify a gold-assisted exfoliation method that underpins a universal route for producing large-area monolayers and thus supports studies of fundamental properties and potential application of two-dimensional materials.},

            Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted extensive attraction due to their unique properties in novel physical phenomena, such as superconductors, Moiré superlattices, ferromagnetics, Weyl semimetals, which all require the high quality of 2D TMDs. Mechanical exfoliation (ME) as a top-down strategy shows great potential to obtain 2D TMDs with high quality and large scale. This paper reviews the theoretical and experimental details of this method. Subsequently, diverse modified ME methods are introduced. Significantly, the recent progress of the Au-assisted ME method is the highlight. Finally, this review will have an insight into their advantages and limitations, and point out a rational direction for the exfoliation of TMDs with high quality and large size.},

	abstract = {The traditional use of Scotch tape for exfoliating layers of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been compared with a gel-assisted mechanical exfoliation technique, using MoS2 as a representative TMD. The gel-assisted exfoliation process, which makes use of both Scotch tape and a gel film, is superior to the use of Scotch tape alone, as it gives a higher probability of obtaining larger surface area few-layer flakes. A quantitative analysis has been made between the samples prepared by the two techniques. The total density of flakes transferred onto a sample by Scotch tape alone was much higher than when using the gel film. However, most of the transferred flakes were several microns in thickness with lateral dimensions {\textless}10 µm. Therefore, the higher percentage of few-layer flakes with large lateral dimensions ({\textgreater} 20 µm) transferred using gel film is very advantageous. Since samples prepared using gel film have fewer flakes, the contacting of potential thin flakes on the sample can be done conveniently. Also, unlike Scotch tape, the gel film does not leave adhesive residue on the substrate. Optical microscopy, contrast difference measurements and Raman spectroscopy were used for identification of the few-layer MoS2 flakes.},

	abstract = {We observe subpicosecond charge separation and formation of indirect excitons a van der Waals heterostructure formed by molybdenum disulfide and molybdenum diselenide monolayers. The sample is fabricated by manually stacking monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 flakes prepared by mechanical exfoliation. Photoluminescence measurements confirm the formation of an effective heterojunction. In the transient absorption measurements, an ultrafast laser pulse resonantly injects excitons in the MoSe2 layer of the heterostructure. Differential reflection of a probe pulse tuned to the MoS2 exciton resonance is immediately observed following the pump excitation. This proves ultrafast transfer of electrons from MoSe2 to MoS2 layers, despite the strong Coulomb attraction from the holes in the resonantly excited excitons. Conversely, when excitons are selectively injected in MoS2, holes transfer to MoSe2 on an ultrafast time scale, too, as observed by measuring the differential reflection of a probe tuned to the MoSe2 resonance. The ultrafast charge transfer process is followed by the formation of spatially indirect excitons with electrons and holes residing in different layers. The lifetime of these indirect excitons are found to be longer than that of the direct excitons in individual MoS2 and MoSe2 monolayers.},

Using strain-gradient engineering, the flexo-photovoltaic effect, that is, the strain-gradient-induced bulk photovoltaic effect, can be activated in centrosymmetric semiconductors, considerably expanding material choices for future sensing and energy applications. Here we report an experimental demonstration of the flexo-photovoltaic effect in an archetypal two-dimensional material, MoS2, by using a strain-gradient engineering approach based on the structural inhomogeneity and phase transition of a hybrid system consisting of MoS2 and VO2. The experimental bulk photovoltaic coefficient in MoS2 is orders of magnitude higher than that in most non-centrosymmetric materials. Our findings unveil the fundamental relation between the flexo-photovoltaic effect and a strain gradient in low-dimensional materials, which could potentially inspire the exploration of new optoelectronic phenomena in strain-gradient-engineered materials.},

Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

While graphene nanosheets (GN) provide an excellent physical barrier against corrosive agent diffusion, thus lowering the permeability of anti-corrosion coatings, they have the side-effect of decreasing IR stealth. In this work, the anti-corrosion properties of 100-μm-thick composite epoxy coatings with various concentrations (0.01–1 wt.\%) of GN fillers thermally reduced at different temperatures (300 °C, 700 °C, 1100 °C) are first compared. The performance was characterized by potentiodynamic polarization scanning, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, water contact angle and salt spray tests. The corrosion resistance for coatings was found to be optimum at a very low filler concentration (0.05 wt.\%). The corrosion current density was 4.57 × 10−11 A/cm2 for GN reduced at 1100 °C, showing no degradation after 500 h of salt-spray testing: a significant improvement over the anti-corrosion behavior of epoxy coatings. Further, to suppress the high IR thermal signature of GN and epoxy, Al was added to the optimized composite at different concentrations. The increased IR emissivity due to GN was not only eliminated but was in fact reduced relative to the pure epoxy. These optimized coatings of Al-GN-epoxy not only exhibited greatly reduced IR emissivity but also showed no sign of corrosion after 500 h of salt spray test.},

The monolayer efficiencies are generally found to be low, while the multilayer efficiencies of infinite stacks show great promise. Furthermore, the out-of-plane shift current response is considered, and material candidates for efficient out-of-plane shift current devices are identified. Among the screened materials, MXY Janus and MX2 transition metal dichalchogenides (TMDs) constitute a prominent subset, with chromium based MXY Janus TMDs holding particular promise. Finally, in order to explain the band gap dependence of the PV efficiency, a simple gapped graphene model with a variable band gap is established and related to the calculated efficiencies.},

For microscopic characterization, the Helios NanoLab 600i microscope and the Helios G4 CXe with the Quanta XFlash 630 energy dispersive spectroscopy detector from Bruker were used. The innovative multi-threaded approach to the SEM preparation itself, which allows us to retain information about the actual microstructure and ensure high material contrast even for elements with similar atomic numbers was proposed. The fracture technique was the most noninvasive for microstructure, whereas FIB/PFIB results in better material contrast (even than EDS). There were only subtle differences in cross sections made by FIB-Ga and PFIB-Xe, but the decrease in local amorphization or slightly better contrast was in favor of Xe plasma. It was found that reliable information about the properties of modern nanomaterials, especially multilayers, can be obtained by analyzing a two-part SEM image, where the first one is a fracture, while the second is a PFIB cross section.},

Recently, ferroelectricity, a phenomenon exhibiting reversible spontaneous electrical polarization, has been observed in zero-degree aligned van der Waals structures. In these artificial stacks, the single-domain size is limited by angle misalignment. Here we show that naturally rhombohedrally stacked MoS2 can host a homogeneous spontaneous polarization throughout the exfoliated flakes, free of misalignment. Utilizing this homogeneous polarization and its induced depolarization field, we build a graphene–MoS2-based photovoltaic device with high efficiency. Few-layer MoS2 is thinner than most oxide-based ferroelectric films, which allows us to maximize the depolarization field and study its impact at the atomically thin limit, whereas the highly uniform polarization in the commensurate crystal enables a tangible path for upscaling. The external quantum efficiency of our device is up to 16\% at room temperature, over one order larger than the highest efficiency observed in bulk photovoltaic devices, owing to the reduced screening in graphene, exciton-enhanced light–matter interaction and ultrafast interlayer relaxation. Our findings make rhombohedral transition metal dichalcogenides a promising candidate for applications such as energy-efficient photodetection with high speed and programmable polarity.},

            It is highly desirable for exploring and discovering new materials and outcome‐based approaches to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit for single‐junction photovoltaic cells. Low‐dimensional piezoelectric materials have the potential to generate the optoelectronic phenomenon called the bulk photovoltaic effect, which is not limited by the theoretical limit for solar radiation into electricity conversion. The recent development of 2D materials has demonstrated that by using the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) for crystals lacking inversion symmetry, it is possible to overcome this limit. So far, the exploration of p–n junction designs has been addressed in several review articles. However, the mechanism of BPVE differs from traditional p–n junction‐based photovoltaics in 2D materials. In this focused review, various concepts regarding the shift‐current response are explored, both from theoretical and experimental points of view, which are generated in the framework of deformed 2D materials. Finally, prospective approaches for building BPVE‐based next‐generation solar cells using ultrathin 2D materials are presented. These materials are expected to work better than current methods of turning energy into electricity.},

In particular, vertical integration of these two-dimensional crystals to form van der Waals heterostructures can open up a new dimension for the design of functional electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here we report the layer-number-dependent photocurrent generation in graphene/MoS2/graphene heterostructures by creating a device with two distinct regions containing one-layer and seven-layer MoS2 to exclude other extrinsic factors. Photoresponse studies reveal that photoresponsivity in one-layer MoS2 is surprisingly higher than that in seven-layer MoS2 by seven times. Spectral-dependent studies further show that the internal quantum efficiency in one-layer MoS2 can reach a maximum of 65\%, far higher than the 7\% in seven-layer MoS2. Our theoretical modelling shows that asymmetric potential barriers in the top and bottom interfaces of the graphene/one-layer MoS2/graphene heterojunction enable asymmetric carrier tunnelling, to generate usually high photoresponsivity in one-layer MoS2 device.},

SUS304 austenite and SUS329J4L duplex SS samples partly covered by gold were set in a minicell. To remove the original film, the SS surface but gold was etched using dilute sulfuric acid. After cleaning, open circuit potential (OCP), and distance from the sample surface to the top of the gold were measured. They were then immersed in either 1.0\% NaCl; 5.0\% NaCl; or aqueous solution with pH ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 and measured again. Differences between the first and subsequent measures of OCP suggested a passive film had formed in solution with pH ranging from 2.8 to 10.0. Similarly, differences among AFM measures revealed the observed film thickness increased with increase in pH and with decrease in chloride ions. Also, film thickness in water was greater than that in a vacuum. Comparison of AFM measurements of passive film on the austenite and sigma phases in sensitized SUS329J4L duplex SS revealed the film was thinner on the sigma phase containing more chromium. Taken together, these findings suggest the proposed method is applicable for measuring the thickness of passive films in aqueous solution.},

However, incorporation of nitrogen into the crystalline lattices of transition metals is thermodynamically unfavorable at atmospheric pressure; most of the known transition metal nitrides are nitrogen-deficient with molar ratios of N:metal less than a unity. In this work, we have formulated a high-pressure route for the synthesis of a nitrogen-rich molybdenum nitride through a solid-state ion-exchange reaction. The newly discovered nitride, 3R–MoN2, adopts a rhombohedral R3m structure, isotypic with MoS2. This new nitride exhibits catalytic activities that are three times more active than the traditional catalyst MoS2 for the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene and more than twice as high in the selectivity to hydrogenation. The nitride is also catalytically active in sour methanation of syngas with {\textgreater}80\% CO and H2 conversion at 723 K. Our formulated route for the synthesis of 3R–MoN2 is at a moderate pressure of 3.5 GPa and, thus, is feasible for industrial-scale catalyst production.},

	abstract = {Slip avalanches are ubiquitous phenomena occurring in three-dimensional materials under shear strain, and their study contributes immensely to our understanding of plastic deformation, fragmentation, and earthquakes. So far, little is known about the role of shear strain in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here we show some evidence of 2D slip avalanches in exfoliated rhombohedral MoS2, triggered by shear strain near the threshold level. Utilizing interfacial polarization in 3R-MoS2, we directly probe the stacking order in multilayer flakes and discover a wide variety of polarization domains with sizes following a power-law distribution. These findings suggest that slip avalanches can occur during the exfoliation of 2D materials, and the stacking orders can be changed via shear strain. Our observation has far-reaching implications for the development of new materials and technologies, where precise control over the atomic structure of these materials is essential for optimizing their properties as well as for our understanding of fundamental physical phenomena.},

	abstract = {The phenomena of secondary ionization, avalanche breakdown and microplasma phenomena in p-n junctions are analyzed using a simplified model in which holes and electrons have identical properties described by four constants. Only two scattering processes for carriers are considered, each having two constants: generation of highest energy or Raman phonons, energy ER and mean-free-path LR; ionization or electron-hole pair production, threshold carrier energy Ei and mean-free-path Li. ER is determined from neutron scattering data; ER = 0·063 eV for Si and 0·037 eV for Ge. The other three constants are adjustable. Ei and Li/LR = r are chosen to fit data on quantum yield for photons with 1 {\textless}hv {\textless} eV using the formula Q = 3−2 exp(Eg+2Ei−hv)2rER. For silicon this gives Ei = 1·1 eV (which is equal to the energy gap Eg) and r = 17·5. For germanium Ei is also about 1·1 eV and r = 57. The simple model predicts that the ionization coefficient α(F) varies with field F as (qFrER)exp −(EiqLRF) which is in good agreement with data for electrons in silicon if LR is set equal to 50 Å. The model predicts an energy per pair for ionization by high-energy particles of about 2·2 Ei+rER which is in good agreement with measured values. It also predicts a hot-carrier random energy of about 0·2 eV for F = 400,000 V/cm, which agrees with the spectra of hole-electron recombination in microplasmas. Thus the three adjustable constants permit fitting six pieces of experimental data in four independent experiments in spite of the fact that the intricacies of the band structure are disregarded. The effects of statistical spatial fluctuations of donor and acceptor ions are considered and it is concluded that these will be randomly distributed according to a Poisson distribution. This randomness leads to a characteristic fluctuation voltage (qFBK)12 − 0·3 V for silicon where FB is the breakdown field, and the dielectric constant K = 1·04 × 10−12 F/cm for silicon. The effect of these fluctuations is to produce local regions in a p-n junction with breakdown about 0·7 V lower than the average in uncompensated material. The fluctuations of voltage are larger by [(Nd+Na)(Nd−Na)]12 in compensated material. The fluctuations can increase the apparent ionization coefficient substantially. Microplasma effects are considered and it is shown that in a junction with only the Poisson fluctuations the microplasma should be stabilized by an apparent series resistance due to space charge of magnitude 1υmaxK − 105 Ω where υmax = (ERm∗)12 is the limiting drift velocity. This is much larger than the spreading resistance term of magnitude 1μFBK − 2000 Ω. It is concluded that typical noisy microplasma phenomena are probably associated with localized structural defects probably having two characteristics: (1) they increase the effect ionization coefficient to a value greater than 105 cm−1 over a region less than 10−5 cm long; (2) they have a mechanism for capturing charge which increases the field once the microplasma has formed. Small SiO2 precipitates and dense arrays of dislocations appear to have the requisite properties. Metal precipitates in the space-charge layer produce “soft” reverse characteristics with localized currents of the form V6±1.
Résumé
Un modèle simplifié, où électrons et trous ont des propriétés identiques décrites par quatre constantes a été employé pour analyser les phénomènes d'ionisation secondaire, de microplasma et de rupture à avalanche. Seuls deux procédés de diffusion de porteurs, ayant chacun deux constantes, sont considérés: génération de phonons Raman ayant la plus grande énergie (énergie ER et libre parcours moyen LR); ionisation ou production d'électrons-trous (limite d'énergie de porteur Ei et libre parcours moyen Li). ER est déterminée par les données de diffusion des neutrons; ER = 0,063 eV pour le Si et 0,037 pour le Ge. Les trois autres constantes peuvent être ajustées. Ei et Li/LR = r ont été choisies de facon à s'adapter au rendement quantique des photons d'après la formule Q = 3−2 exp(Eg+2Ei−h)2rE, avec la limite 1 {\textless}h {\textless}5 eV. Ceci donne pour le silicium, Ei = 1,1 eV (valeur égale a l'intervalle d'énergie Eg) et r = 17,5. Pour le germanium, Ei est aussi environ 1,1 eV et r = 57. Le modèle simplifié prédit que le coefficient d'ionisation α(F) varie en fonction du champ F d'après l'expression (qFrER)exp −(EiqLRF), ce qui est en accord avec les données de Chynoweth pour les électrons dans le Silicium si L = 50 Å. Le modèle prédit une valeur de 2,2 Ei+ER pour l'énergie de chaque paire obtenue par ionisation de particule à haute ènergie; ce résultat s'accorde avec les valeurs mesurées. Il prèdit aussi une énergie aléatoire de porteur à chaud d'environ 0,2 eV pour F = 400.000 V/cm, en accord avec le spectre de recombinaisons trou-electron des microplasma. Ainsi les trois constantes qui peuvent être choisies permettent d'ajuster six données expérimentales dans quatre expériences indépendantes malgrè que l'on ignore les complications de la structure de bande. Les effets des fluctuations statistiques d'espace des ions donneurs et accepteurs sont analysés et on conclut que ceux-ci seront distribués aléatoirement en accord avec une distribution de Poisson. Cette tendance aléatoire menè a une tension caractéristique de fluctuation d'après l'équation (qFBK)12 − 0,3 V pour le Silicium, FB étant le champ de rupture et K la constante ` diélectrique (+1,04×10−12F/cm). L'effet de ces fluctuations est de produire des régions localisées dans une jonction p-n ayant des tensions de rupture d'environ 0,7 V de moins que la moyenne dans un materiau non-compensé. Les fluctuations peuvent augmenter sensiblement le coefficient d'ionisation apparent dans un matériau compensé, le facteur d'augmentation des fluctuations étant sol[(Nd+Na)(Nd−Na)]12 dans ces mêmes conditions. Les effets microplasma sont considérés et on démontre que dans une jonction, ne comprenant que les seules fluctuations de Poisson, le microplasma doit être stabilisé par une resistance en série apparente dûe à la charge d'espace de valeur 1υmax. K ⋍ 105 Ω ou υmax = (ERm∗)12 est la limite de la vitesse d'apport. La resistance d'extension donnée par la formule 1μFBK − 2000 Ω est beaucoup plus petite. On conclut que les phénomènes des microplasmas bruyants typiques sont peut-être associés avec des défauts de structure locaux ayant probablement les deux caractéristiques suivantes: (1) Ils augmentent le coefficient d'ionisation effectif d'une valeur plus grande que 10−1 cm sur une surface moins longue que 10−5 cm; (2) ils possèdent un mécanisme pour capturer des charges qui augmentent le champ, une fois le microplasma formé. De petits précipités de SiO2 et des assemblages denses de dislocations semblent avoir les propriétés requises. Des precipités de métal dans la couche de charge d'espace produisent des caractéristiques ramollies dans le sens inverti avec des courants localisés d'après V6±1.
Zusammenfassung
Die Phänomene der sekundären Ionisation, des Lawinenzusammenbruchs und Mikroplasma-Erscheinungen in p-n-Übergängen werden an einem einfachen Modell erörtert, in dem Löcher und Elektronen identische, durch 4 Konstante bestimmte Eigenschaften besitzen. Nur zwei Streuprozesse für Träger werden berücksichtigt, jeder mit zwei Konstanten: die Erzeugung von Phononen höchster Energie (Raman-Phononen), Energie ER, und die mittlere freie Weglänge LR; die Ionisation oder Elektron-Loch-Paar Erzeugung, Schwellenenergie der Träger Ei, mittlere freie Weglänge Li. ER wird durch Neutronenstreuung bestimmt; ER = 0,063 eV für Si und 0,037 eV für Ge. Die übrigen drei Konstanten sind regulierbar. Ei und Li/LR = r werden so gewählt, dass sie der Quantenausbeute für Photonen (1 {\textless}h {\textless}5 eV) entsprechen, wobei die Formel Q = 3−2 exp(Eg+2Ei−h)2rER benutzt wird. Für Silizium ist Ei = 1,1 eV (gleich der Energielücke Eg), r = 17,5. Für Germanium ist Ei ebenfalls etwa 1,1 eV und r = 57. Nach dem einfachen Modell soll der Ionisationskoeffizient α(F) mit den Feld nach folgender Beziehung variieren: (qFrERexp−(EiqLRF). Dies steht in guter Übereinstimmung mit Chynoweths Angaben für Elektronen in Silizium, wenn man LR = 50 Å setzt. Die Energie eines Paares bei Ionisation durch hochenergetische Teilchen soll nach dem Modell etwa 2,2Ei+rER betragen, was mit den Messungen gut übereinstimmt. Die statistische Energie der heissen Träger sollte etwa 0,2 eV sein, wenn F = 400 000 V/cm. Dies stimmt mit den Spektren der Rekombination von Löchern und Elektronen im Mikroplasma überein. Mit Hilfe der drei regulierbaren Konstanten lassen sich also 6 experimentelle Messungsergebnisse in 4 unabhängige Versuche einfügen, obwohl man die komplexe Bandstruktur nicht berücksichtigt. Die Effekte statistischer räumlicher Schwankungen der Donator und Akzeptorionen werden in Betracht gezogen, mit dem Ergebnis, dass diese nach einer Poissonschen Verteilung statistisch angeordnet sind. Dies führt zu einer charakteristischen Schwankungsspannung (qFBK)12 − 0,3 V für Silizium, wo FB das Feld beim Zusammenbruch und K die Dielektrizitätskonstante +1,04 × ×10−12F/cm für Si ist. Durch diese Schwankungen entstehen in einem p-n-Übergang lokale Zonen, deren Zusammenbruchsspannung um etwa 0,7 V niedriger ist als der Durchschnitt in nicht kompensiertem Material. Hier sind die Spannungsschwankungen um [(Nd+Na)(Nd−Na)]12 grösser. Diese Schwankungen können den scheinbaren Ionisationskoeffizienten beträchtlich erhöhen. Mikroplasmaerscheinungen werden dann erörtert, und es wird gezeigt, dass in einem Übergang, in dem nur Poisson-Schwankungen auftreten, das Mikroplasma durch einen scheinbaren Serienwiderstand stabilisiert werden sollte, der von einer Raumladung der Grösse 1υmaxK ⋍ 105 Ω herrührt, wo υmax = (ERm)12 der Grenzwert der Driftgeschweindigkeit ist. Dieser Wert ist viel grösser als der Ausbreitungswiderstand von 1υFBK ⋍ 2000 Ω. Typpsche Rauscherscheinungen im Mikroplasma werden lokalisierten Strukturdefekten zugeschrieben, die wahrscheinlich zwei Kennzeichen haben: (1) Sie erhöhen den effektiven Ionisationskoeffizienten auf einen Wert von über 105 cm−1 über eine weniger als 10−5 cm lange Zone. (2) Sie sind imstande, Ladung einzufangen, die nach Bildung des Mikroplasmas das Feld verstärkt. Kleine Niederschläge von SiO2 und dichte Anordnungen von Dislokationen scheinen die erforderlichen Eigenschaften zu besitzen. Metallniederschläge in der Raumladungsschicht erzeugen “weiche” Umkehrcharakteristiken mit lokalislierten Strömen der Form V6±1.},

The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30\% for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1.

	abstract = {Photodetectors and display backplane transistors based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have been regarded as promising topics. However, most studies have focused on the improvement in the performances of the MoS2 photodetector itself or emerging applications. In this study, to suggest a better insight into the photodetector performances of MoS2 thin film transistors (TFTs), as photosensors for possible integrated system, we performed a comparative study on the photoresponse of MoS2 and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFTs. As a result, in the various wavelengths and optical power ranges, MoS2 TFTs exhibit 2{\textasciitilde}4 orders larger photo responsivities and detectivities. The overall quantitative comparison of photoresponse in single device and inverters confirms a much better performance by the MoS2 photodetectors. Furthermore, as a strategy to improve the field effect mobility and photoresponse of the MoS2 TFTs, molecular doping via poly-L-lysine (PLL) treatment was applied to the MoS2 TFTs. Transfer and output characteristics of the MoS2 TFTs clearly show improved photocurrent generation under a wide range of illuminations (740{\textasciitilde}365 nm). These results provide useful insights for considering MoS2 as a next-generation photodetector in flat panel displays and makes it more attractive due to the fact of its potential as a high-performance photodetector enabled by a novel doping technique.},

	abstract = {Photodetectors based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been widely reported in the literature and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been the most extensively explored for photodetection applications. The properties of MoS2, such as direct band gap transition in low dimensional structures, strong light–matter interaction and good carrier mobility, combined with the possibility of fabricating thin MoS2 films, have attracted interest for this material in the field of optoelectronics. In this work, MoS2-based photodetectors are reviewed in terms of their main performance metrics, namely responsivity, detectivity, response time and dark current. Although neat MoS2-based detectors already show remarkable characteristics in the visible spectral range, MoS2 can be advantageously coupled with other materials to further improve the detector performance Nanoparticles (NPs) and quantum dots (QDs) have been exploited in combination with MoS2 to boost the response of the devices in the near ultraviolet (NUV) and infrared (IR) spectral range. Moreover, heterostructures with different materials (e.g., other TMDs, Graphene) can speed up the response of the photodetectors through the creation of built-in electric fields and the faster transport of charge carriers. Finally, in order to enhance the stability of the devices, perovskites have been exploited both as passivation layers and as electron reservoirs.},

            2D material based photodetectors have attracted many research projects due to their unique structures and excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties. These 2D materials, including semimetallic graphene, semiconducting black phosphorus, transition metal dichalcogenides, insulating hexagonal boron nitride, and their various heterostructures, show a wide distribution in bandgap values. To date, hundreds of photodetectors based on 2D materials have been reported. Here, a review of photodetectors based on 2D materials covering the detection spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared is presented. First, a brief insight into the detection mechanisms of 2D material photodetectors as well as introducing the figure‐of‐merits which are key factors for a reasonable comparison between different photodetectors is provided. Then, the recent progress on 2D material based photodetectors is reviewed. Particularly, the excellent performances such as broadband spectrum detection, ultrahigh photoresponsivity and sensitivity, fast response speed and high bandwidth, polarization‐sensitive detection are pointed out on the basis of the state‐of‐the‐art 2D photodetectors. Initial applications based on 2D material photodetectors are mentioned. Finally, an outlook is delivered, the challenges and future directions are discussed, and general advice for designing and realizing novel high‐performance photodetectors is given to provide a guideline for the future development of this fast‐developing field.},

              Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years. This family of materials allows for the realization of versatile electronic devices and holds promise for next-generation (opto)electronics. Their electronic properties strongly depend on the number of layers, making them interesting from a fundamental standpoint. For electronic applications, semiconducting 2D materials benefit from sizable mobilities and large on/off ratios, due to the large modulation achievable
              via
              the gate field-effect. Moreover, being mechanically strong and flexible, these materials can withstand large strain ({\textgreater}10\%) before rupture, making them interesting for strain engineering and flexible devices. Even in their single layer form, semiconducting 2D materials have demonstrated efficient light absorption, enabling large responsivity in photodetectors. Therefore, semiconducting layered 2D materials are strong candidates for optoelectronic applications, especially for photodetection. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in photodetectors based on semiconducting 2D materials, focusing on the transition metal dichalcogenides, novel van der Waals materials, black phosphorus, and heterostructures.},

Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30\% for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1.

            The Shockley-Queisser limit describes the maximum solar energy conversion efficiency achievable for a particular material and is the standard by which new photovoltaic technologies are compared. This limit is based on the principle of detailed balance, which equates the photon flux into a device to the particle flux (photons or electrons) out of that device. Nanostructured solar cells represent a novel class of photovoltaic devices and questions have been raised about whether or not they can exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit. Here we show that single-junction nanostructured solar cells have a theoretical maximum efficiency of ∼42\% under AM 1.5 solar illumination. While this exceeds the efficiency of a non-concentrating planar device, it does not exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit for a planar device with optical concentration. We consider the effect of diffuse illumination and find that with optical concentration from the nanostructures of only × 1,000, an efficiency of 35.5\% is achievable even with 25\% diffuse illumination. We conclude that nanostructured solar cells offer an important route towards higher efficiency photovoltaic devices through a built-in optical concentration.},

              Two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received much attention in nonlinear optical applications due to their unique crystal structures and second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. However, SHG signals in TMDs show a layer-dependent behavior, consistent with the presence (absence) of inversion symmetry in even-layer (odd-layer) of TMDs. Herein, we synthesized monolayer and bilayer 2H and 3R phase vanadium (V)-doped MoS

              crystal. Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and STEM were used to identify the chemical composition and crystalline structure of as-grown nanoflakes. SHG measurement was used to research the symmetry of V-doped MoS

Its existence has been demonstrated almost 50 years ago, but predictive theories only appeared in the last ten years, allowing for the identification of different mechanisms and the determination of their relative importance in real materials. It is now generally accepted that there is an intrinsic mechanism that is insensitive to scattering, called shift current, where first-principles calculations can now give highly accurate predictions. Another important but more extrinsic mechanism, called ballistic current, is also attracting a great deal of attention, but due to the complicated scattering processes, its numerical calculation for real materials is only made possible quite recently. In addition, an intrinsic ballistic current, usually referred to as injection current, will appear under circularly polarized light and has wide application in experiments. In this review, experiments that are pertinent to the theory development are reviewed, and a significant portion is devoted to discussing the recent progress in the theories of BPVE and their numerical implementations. As a demonstration of the capability of the newly developed theories, a brief review of the materials' design strategies enabled by the theory development is given. Finally, remaining questions in the BPVE field and possible future directions are discussed to inspire further investigations.},

            A bulk photovoltaic effect was studied in a chiral smectic crystal phase of a bisfluorophenylterthiophene derivative bearing two lactate moieties doped with a fullerene derivative. The chiral smectic crystal phase was a ferroelectric and macroscopically polarized state that could be formed by cooling the sample from a chiral smectic A phase under a DC bias application. The fullerene derivatives aggregated to form microcrystals which promoted hole–electron dissociation in the polarized smectic phase. The open circuit voltage exceeded 1.2 V and the external quantum efficiency was around 80∼50\% under near UV and blue light illumination. This open circuit voltage exceeds those of the organic solar cells using a fullerene-based acceptor. The polarity of the photovoltaic effect could be inverted by the change of the poling bias during the phase transition into the smectic crystal phase. Unlike conventional organic thin film solar cells, the photovoltaic effect was observed in a symmetrical cell consisting of an ITO cathode and anode. Moreover, thick films of around 1–2 μm can be used for the bulk photovoltaic devices. The concentration of the fullerene derivative was only 8 mol\%. However, the dissociation of excitons into hole and electrons was promoted because the relative permittivity exceeded 30.},
